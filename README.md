# Isolation
A C++ implementation of the board game [Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(board_game)). Designed to practice building agents and playing the game with them.

## Compilation
At the moment the project doesn't need any per-machine configuration. To compile simply download, and run `make` in the directory with the [Makefile](./Makefile). It should compile everything and generate the `tournament` binary.

## Issues
I've used this framework for several semesters in my Artificial Intelligence course. So far no bugs have been reported by students. If you notice anything you would like to report, please feel free to create an issue.
